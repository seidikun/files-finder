[UPDATE] - 08.11.2018

- Changed some logic on Merge mode:
	- Matching is now made by path and filename, but not with bytes anymore. The 
	logic is that there can't be more than one same filename in a folder, but bytes
	could change between mapping and merge. This solved multiple matching, also.
	- strfind was substituted by strcmp (case-insensitive), which is much faster
	and returns indexes already.

[UPDATE] - 07.11.2018

- Now each all to merge produces a mergeLog. The generalLog will ocntain only
important events (call to Mapping, Filtering and/or Merge) and link to files
generated (filteredList and mergeLog)
- A logic of folders exception was introduced in Mapping mode, using regular 
expression logic used in dirPlus (see 'DirFilter' parameter). It is not really
working, as some folders weren't really filtered out.

[DESCRIPTION] - 07.11.2018

Part1 - Mapping Mode: create an excel containing all files from a list of mapped 
folders (including files from folders inside folders).
Or iterate an existing excel with new items (this is the missing part)

Part2 - Filtering Mode: from a list of folders, extensions (.txt, .xlsx, .docs ...),
tags (RAWDATA, UTILITY_CODE ...), status ('Active', 'Important' ...) and substring,
user select appropriate filters and the program makes another excel list, but with 
just the items which go under the filters
	User can then edit these filtered lists, for example giving them tags, comments, 
changing status

Part3 - Merge Mode: Take each excel produced on Part2 and merge the changes to the
excel produced on Part1

So Part 1 produces the main list, Part 2 produces the filtered lists and Part 3 do 
control of changes


Part 1 is to be used, for example, once to produce the main list and then once a 
week, to update changes on files inside the mapped folders (if new items were 
included, for example)

Part 2 is to be used any time, if I want to gather all files under specific 
filters (e.g.: give me all .pdf files with tags 
LINGUISTICS and AI and RUSSIAN inside folders Books and Papers with status except
'Already Read'))

Then as I use the .pdf, for example, during a bibliography review, I can comment
what I read and put 'Already Read' after finishing each of them

Part 3 is then used after this, to make all changes go to main excel
